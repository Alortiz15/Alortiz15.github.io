        Hello, right now as you may know I am in High School in San Jose, Calfornia.
        The next education I can get is to go to a University, where I hope to study
        a proffesion. Right now I really do not know what I am going to do, however 
        I have an idea of what to do. I am think about being a Aerospace Engineer. Or
        I might want to be a Software Engineer. I still have to think about this. Besides
        my profession, I want to go to UCLA but I need to know what I want to be so I
        know UCLA has that profession.
            
        </p>
