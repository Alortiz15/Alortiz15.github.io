            Hello, yesterday I finished making my second scratch game in which I took a lot of time to make. The comparsion between this game and my first games is the freedom.
            This time around I got to choose what type of game or project I got to make with some rules to follow like including a variable and more than one sprite. I had a fun 
            this time around creating the game. I had a very good idea of what to make which partly came from the example projects. So then I started my game an created everthing
            from scratch(not the program) I made my own sprites and backdrops. In the end I went through challenges but overcame them one way or another like any other programmer.
            I didn't struggle as much with this game as with my other game(probably because I didn't know as much as I do now). This second game is partly complex but, not as much
            as my first game(which had multiscreen; a series of different screens or levels). I also planned my game differently, I didn't make a draft such as my first game. I just
            went on making the scripts and having an idea of what I'll do(which is probably winging it). I coded in the way of just having a goal and acomplishing it.This actually
            made me focus more running less into problems. Overalll my second game is much more effective with it's code, and much more easier to make.

            <h2>Day 1 of CS50x</h2>
            <p>
            Today we watch our first CS50 lecture, and by "our" I am refering to the class. The main idea of CS50 is 
            probleming sloving and think computationally. My first impression is the lessons are going to be very
            detailed and hard to understand espcially the computer terms the lecture uses. The first lecture talked
            about bits and algorithms. I learned that bits represent 0s and 1s. I also learned that exponents and decimals
            are used to show numbers. The first algorithum we learned was to search a name in a phonebook. Instead of going
            page be page looking for a name, we broke it down and took half of the problem away from the begining
            making the algorithum more efficient. The cons of the lecture has to be the speed. I feel that I can not take
            good or effective notes when I can not catch up to the lecture. I probably have to pause during the video lectures.
            Overall the lecture was interesting, informative, somewhat confusing, fast, and specific.

            Hello, this is a blog about me Alonso Ortiz taking Accelerated Computer Science(ACS).
            I am writing this blog in order to see my progress in ACS. The advantage here is being able to see my
            way of learning and critical think about it. For example let’s say I learn about HTML and what specific 
            code part I learned that day; “today I learned about “a href” which makes links out of text.” Two months 
            later I need to know how to link text from HTML for this project.  Looking back __ for now I can use info
            from ACS for whatever reason. This would be like me taking notes, however thinking about process also. 
            Back to the “a href”, the href stands for hypertext reference. Hyper for fast; reference to refer, so the
            text refers to something else fast. That is critical thinking, and what I am really hoping to do is 
            create useful info into this blog.<br>
            More about ACS, I am taking ACS because I really enjoy coding and think it is very interesting. My plans
            for ACS is learning advance coding for my level. Like I said before I enjoy coding, and feel like I need 
            to learn more code. Now that I am thinking about my ACS plans I wonder if I want to take coding to a profession.
            It would be cool to code websites, games, software, cars, music, and maybe robots. I’ll make that decision
            through the next 3 years hopefully. Right now I just want to focus on new code languages and functions<br>
